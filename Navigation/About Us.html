        <p>Since 1985, Cool Store has been the pride and joy of the TownPlace community 
            We have strived to provide the best services to our customers and vendors 
            since then. Over the years, we have refined and improved our ability to 
            address the needs and accessabilities of our customers and vendors. From 
            our humble beginings to our current sprawling selection of stores from 
            boutiques to bouncy castles.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, Cool Store stands as the cultural touchstone of TownPlace. A spot for 
            everyone, young and old to congregate and engage withe their fellow 
            neighbors and friends. We aim to make memories and fun above all else, and 
            strive for all avenues that help facilitate this goal.
