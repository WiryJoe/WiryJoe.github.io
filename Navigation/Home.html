            Last march, we had to say a sad goodbye to Sneed's feed and seed. In the time
            since then, the shop has sat empty, waiting for a new onwer to call it home.
            Last month, it finally happened. Owner Jim Slims knew this mall was his new 
            place to call home. On monday, we are celebrating the grand opening of Jim's cooking!
            All patrons are encouraged to attend and benefit from the opening sale! The kitchen
            of your dreams can finally be a reality. Just head down to Cool Store and say hi.
            We would love to have you.
