                YOU THINK SO?

                Sorry, didn't mean for that.

                I tried to make something some days ago. As you can see, it hasn't 
                amounted to much. I don't understand all this to be completely honest.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Haha I can see that. I'm not too sure about all of this either. 
                You should ask Jim about it, he seems to know what he's doing.

            <span class="Bob">Bob: 
                I'm not so sure it's that easy. He hasn't even staffed the store yet, 
                let alone is he there during business hours yet.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                You can just message him through the website, on his page.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Bob">Bob: 
                I'm not sure how I would do that.
