            <span class="you">You: 
                Hello, Samantha, I wanted to ask a few questions about your website
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Sam">Sam:
                Hey sounds good, what did you want to know?
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Well frankly it looks pretty good, I was wondering how you learned it
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Sam">Sam:
                Haha, I don't know about that. I just threw in some stuff I learned to 
                show off a little bit
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Well how did you learn it then?
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Sam">Sam: 
                Funnily enough, I just picked up a book from Bob's books. 
                Pretty helpful stuff. Not too hard to get a hang of either
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Ha, that's ironic, considering his website so far, you should 
                take a look at it when you can, it's "awesome"
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Sam">Sam: 
                Oh I've seen it, can't hardly blame him,he's a busy guy you know?
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Yeah I guess so, so how did you manage to figure the website out?
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Sam">Sam: 
                Well for a good long while, I was just sitting there trying to think of 
                something. I wanted to make sure it was the perfect thing. I mean 
                my store is my livelyhood after all so I wanted to make sure it was 
                great. I spent a good 4 days sitting there before I finally decided 
                that I just had to do something, even if I wasn't as happy with 
                it as I could be. Really it just went on from there. I did 
                my best, and even if it's not great, I think I can be proud to say that 
                it's mine. If that makes sense.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Hmm, just start it huh?
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Sam">Sam: 
                Yup, pretty much. Of course it helps to do a little learning first of course
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Well yeah. Say, you wouldn't happen to still have that book, would you?
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Sam">Sam: 
                Well I was hoping to look through it a little more, I still want to get some 
                of the formatting better, but I suppose I could let you take a look 
                at it. Don't tear it up too much, Bob would kill you (and me probably)
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Will do, I'll do my best with it I promise
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Sam">Sam:
