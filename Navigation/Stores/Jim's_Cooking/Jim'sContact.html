                Hello
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Your website is looking pretty good, how did you do it?
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Jim">Jim:
                Well I spent the week learning HTML and CSS, it's pretty hard, but 
                I managed to find the time.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Really? Who did you have to teach you?
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Jim">Jim:
                oh, nobody really. I found some information online. Pretty limited and 
                I had to piece together most of it myself, but the internet is 
                 a pretty helpful place.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                The internet? C'mon man, that's just a trendy new thing.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Jim">Jim:
                Nope, it's come a long way. A decade or so of development is nothing 
                to scoff at. I'm sure you'll find something.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="you">You: 
                Well I'll see what I can find. Thanks Jim.
                <br><br></span>
            <span class="Jim">Jim:
                Don't mention it.
