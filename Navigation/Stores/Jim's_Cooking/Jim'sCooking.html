        <h3>
            If that's not to your liking, I also have some personal recipes I love
            to share!
            I haven't gotten to figuring out how to import my whole cookbook but for now,
            have a look at one of my personal favorites. A classic of the frontier - 
            Pemmican!
            <br>
            <br>
        </h3>
            <div class="ingredients">
                You will need the following ingredients for this recipe:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lean beef, doesn't have to be expensive, but the leaner
                        the better
                    </li>
                    <li>Beef tallow. This is a special type of fat from the animal.
                        Most grocery stores will not have it so visiting your local
                        butcher's will probably be your best bet for easy aquisition.
                        Otherwise, you can render fat of the animal yourself. This
                        will also most likely be aquired from the butcher, but should
                        they not have tallow, they will almost certainly have fat.
                    </li>
                    <li>A blender, or mortar and pestle. A mortar and pestle is ideal,
                        but a blender is far easier and works 99% as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>A way to dry the meat. Ideally you have some sort of smoker
                        or dehydrator, but an over will do. If you really want to be
                        authentic, you could also use a campfire or cover the items and
                        let them sun bake.
                    </li>
                    <li>A lot of salt. If you'd like you may also use some berries, herbs
                        and spices.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                Then you must follow these steps to complete the recipe:
                <ol>
                    <li>Firstly you will need to slice the beef into thin strips;
                        the thinner the better!</li>
                    <li>Then you will need to place them on a baking tray if you
                        are using an over. Otherwise use the appropriate cooking
                        dish for the appliance of choice.
                    </li>
                    <li>Then you will need to cook the slices. You should also cook
                        any berries at this point. (Saskatoon berries are the traditional
                        choice) Cooking times vary
                        based on appliance or method, but typically, you will want
                        a very slow cook, at a very low temperature. The thickness
                        of the slices also may affect cooking time. I have had very good
                        experience will 150 degrees in the oven at around 12 hours cooking.
                        If you're not sure about your numbers or your oven does not
                        go that low, as many don't, check regularly every 3 hours for the first 12
                        and an hour or two after that. The meat should be crispy
                        enough that you can break it apart like jerky and you should
                        see no redness inside, the meat should be dark brown, but not black! 
                    </li>
                    <li>Now you will take your dried, crispy meat as well as any
                        berries and use your mortar and pestle or blender. Blend or crush
                        meat and berries seperately. Once your meat is somewhat blended or crushed,
                        add a large helping of salt, about a handful or about 1 cup.
                        This will help preserve it and reinforce the classic taste. 
                        When finished, the meat should be a fine stringy powder.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once your meat is pulverized, place it in a cooking pot around
                        turn the heat to low, just enough to slowly melt the tallow. 
                        Add beef tallow slowly, just a little at a time. Stir 
                        the powder as you add the tallow. It should melt and slowly be 
                        absorbed into the meat powder, darkening and moistening it.
                        Once your powder is completely wetted with tallow, you may stop.
                        The powder should be just barely wetted, not completely soaked, use
                        as little tallow as you can to wet it, while still having enough to
                        wet the whole of the powder.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cool the mixture and once it is at room temperature, wrap it in
                        wax paper or tin foil before placing it in a tupperware and
                        refrigerating it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Voila! You have made pemmican. It is an amazing stock for 
                        soups, pastas, rice, and more! It can also be eaten raw and is 
                        extremely calorie dense. Very little may go a very long way, and
                        it can last for an extremely long time when stored properly.
                        I always try to keep some around to ensure I always have a nice meaty 
                        flavor for my boiled meals like pasta or soup, and it is great for 
                        traveling due to its calorie density and resilience to spoiling.
                    </li>
