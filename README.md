HTML Demo demonstrating my ability to learn and deploy new skills quickly

I studied HTML + CSS for 3 days before commencing work on my project, before spending a single day (about 12 hours of work) making it real. Pulled an all nighter to get it done. Despite the extremely short deadline, I managed to learn and deploy an entirely new set of skills in a basic demo that shows off a couple of key features of the languages. And of course, had a little fun with it here and there as well. Enjoy!

The pixel art portraits of the characters were done by my friend, Daylin, who does a little bit of pixel art. Credit to him on that.
